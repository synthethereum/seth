# Synth sETH — Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the staged development of the Synth sETH ecosystem,
from initial token deployment to a fully decentralized prediction-market
protocol with trust-minimized settlement and governance.

The roadmap is **directional, not time-bound**, and is designed to align
technical milestones with token utility and ecosystem growth.

## Phase 1 — MVP  
**Core Prediction Engine**

**Status:** In progress / Pre-deployment

The primary goal of Phase 1 is to establish a clean, minimal foundation for
on-chain prediction markets powered by Synth sETH.

### Key Deliverables

- Deployment of the **Synth sETH ERC-20 token**
  - Fixed supply: 40,000,000
  - No minting, no rebasing, no taxes
  - Immutable, non-upgradable contract
- Launch of **binary YES / NO market contracts**
  - Pooled liquidity model
  - Liquidity-defined probabilities
  - Transparent on-chain accounting
- Wallet integration and basic web interface
- Admin-driven market settlement
  - Based on verifiable, public, archivable data sources
- Initial curated markets
  - Crypto price targets
  - On-chain metrics
  - Selected real-world events
- Early user tracking
  - Participation metrics
  - Eligibility for future community incentives and airdrops

**Token Utility Activated:**  
Market participation, settlement payouts, early incentive alignment

## Phase 2 — Public Beta  
**User-Generated Markets & Social Layer**

**Status:** Planned

Phase 2 expands the protocol from curated markets into a participatory,
community-driven prediction ecosystem.

### Key Deliverables

- User-generated markets
  - Permissioned templates
  - Community-reviewed market creation
- Reputation and scoring system
  - Accuracy-based metrics
  - Long-term participation incentives
- Leaderboards
  - Traders
  - Market creators
  - Liquidity providers
- Fee-sharing and reward programs
  - Funded from protocol activity
  - Distributed in Synth sETH
- Social features
  - Sharing and referral mechanics
  - Market discovery tools
- Progressive rollout of the **15,000,000 Synth sETH community allocation**
  - Distributed in stages
  - Tied to usage, accuracy, and contribution

**Token Utility Expanded:**  
Governance signaling, incentive distribution, social engagement flywheel

## Phase 3 — Oracle Integration & Full Protocol  
**Decentralized Settlement & Liquidity Incentives**

**Status:** Planned

Phase 3 focuses on minimizing trust assumptions and scaling the protocol
into a fully decentralized prediction layer.

### Key Deliverables

- Integration with decentralized oracle providers
  - Examples: Chainlink, UMA
  - Economically secured data feeds
- On-chain dispute mechanisms
  - Challenge periods
  - Stake-weighted resolution
- Advanced market structures
  - Multi-stage events
  - Conditional outcomes
- Liquidity incentives
  - Targeted programs for key market categories
  - Long-term liquidity alignment
- Cross-chain and Layer 2 deployments
  - Reduced participation costs
  - Expanded user base
- DAO-style governance
  - Market parameters
  - Fee structures
  - Incentive allocation
  - Oracle frameworks

**Token Utility Matured:**  
Governance participation, dispute staking, liquidity alignment

## Roadmap Philosophy

- Security and simplicity take priority over speed
- Token mechanics remain immutable across all phases
- New functionality is introduced at the protocol layer, not the token layer
- Decentralization increases progressively as the ecosystem matures
